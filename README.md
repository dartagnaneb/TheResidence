TheResidence
============

A pit of intelligence for the plan that is TheResidence

After college, Eric, Evan, Jack, maybe some others, will move out to a booming city for young people, and get a large
apartment, that will be made so awesome, it will get it's own name- TheResidence. All one word. Evan, Jack, maybe some 
others, will be involved in some sort of tech start-up(funded by Venture Capital), while Eric is off chillin' in the 
political world. And of course, there will be cats.
