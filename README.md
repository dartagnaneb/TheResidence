TheResidence
============

A pit of intelligence for the plan that is TheResidence

After college, Eric, Josh, Jack, Sam, Evan the ferking hacker, maybe some others, will move out to a booming city for
young people, and get a large apartment, or a house, that will be made so awesome, it will get its own name - TheResidence. All one
word. Evan, Jack, maybe some others, will be involved in some sort of tech start-up (funded by Venture Capital), while
Eric is off chillin' in the political world. And of course, there will be cats.
