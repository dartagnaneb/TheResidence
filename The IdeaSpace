THE BIG IDEA-
After college, Eric, Evan, Jack, Sam, Evan the fracking hacker, maybe some others, will move out to a booming city for
young people, get their own apartments, maybe have a couple room-mate situations. Evan, Jack, maybe some others, 
will be involved in some sort of tech start-up (funded by Venture Capital), while
Eric is off chillin' in the political world. And of course, there will be cats.
THE CITIES-
Currently, the cities being considered are:
  -Seattle, Washington
  -Berkeley, California
  -San Francisco, California
  -Portland, Oregon

THE HOMEBREWERY-
For personal enjoyment, we will brew a new beer each month, for drinking the next month. Because, why not?
